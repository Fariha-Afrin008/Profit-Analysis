## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an interactive Profit Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI, designed to help business stakeholders quickly understand profitability drivers, performance trends, and risk areas across products, time, and segments.

The dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making, performance monitoring, and operational optimization.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

The primary goals of this dashboard are to:

- Identify what drives profit and loss

- Track sales and profit trends over time

- Compare product performance

- Detect high-risk and low-return segments

- Enable data-driven decisions with minimal manual analysis

## 📊 Visual Components & Their Purpose

**Advanced Slicer:**	Dynamic filtering by business dimensions (e.g., category, region, time)

**Standard Slicer:**	Quick user-controlled segmentation

**Treemap:**	Contribution analysis by category / sub-category

**Waterfall Chart:**	Step-by-step profit breakdown

**Line & Stacked Column Chart:**	Sales vs Profit trend comparison

Plots entities (products/segments) based on:

- Sales or quantity

- Profitability

- Helps classify:

- High-volume, low-profit items (risk)
